ðŸ’¤ Drowsiness Detection Web App (Flask + Mediapipe)

This project detects driver drowsiness and yawns in real time using a webcam feed.
It uses Mediapipe Face Mesh for landmark detection and Flask to serve a web interface.
When a person closes their eyes for more than 2 seconds, a drowsiness alert is triggered.
It also counts yawns, blinks, and monitors the personâ€™s distance from the camera to ensure they are visible and close enough.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Real-time face tracking using Mediapipe
âœ… Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)â€“based drowsiness detection
âœ… Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)â€“based yawn detection
âœ… Blink counter and yawn counter
âœ… Distance check â€“ alerts if user is too far from the camera
âœ… Drowsiness alert (sound + red warning text) if eyes remain closed for more than 2 seconds
âœ… Flask web interface â€“ view the live camera feed from a browser
âœ… Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (Windows plays a beep sound)
